                <h3>Software Development Student</h3><br>
                <p>Hi! I’m Mark Angel Castro, I am a Software Development student at Bow Valley College with a strong background in Information and Communications Technology 
                    and a Bachelor’s degree from Pangasinan State University. I have hands-on experience in SEO, content creation, and IT, 
                    where I’ve contributed to improving user engagement and operational efficiency. 
                    My previous role as a Lead Filtering Assistant at Kount Katalyst allowed me to sharpen my ability to analyze data 
                    and drive traffic to websites while ensuring a seamless user experience.
                    I want to transition into full-stack software development, focusing on front-end and back-end technologies. 
                    With a solid foundation in problem-solving, teamwork, and technical skills, I am eager to apply my knowledge 
                    to real-world projects. I am passionate about developing efficient, secure, and user-friendly applications that
                     drive business growth and improve user experiences.</p><br><br>
